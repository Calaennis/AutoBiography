        <p class="lead">About me</p>
		<p>I am 20 years old and have lived in Omaha my entire life.
            I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in game programming
            while also getting a minor in Spanish. I live at home with my mother.
            I have just one sister who is older than me. I am a very chill person
            and absolutely love listening to music! For work I am an intern at
            Union Pacific doing Linux Systems Administration and I also work as a
            teaching assistant for Java I lab here at UNO.
		<p class="lead">What you might not know about me</p>
		I play the marimba! Well, used to. I played it for six and a half years in my
            band years. I unfortunately stopped playing, but should get back into it.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esnBp5yxfCs">A song I used to play 
            (he takes it kinda slow though).</a> <br />
            I also used to take part in holiday parades! I worked with a small company
            that would do performances at malls around certain holidays as fun characters!
            The first picture is the Village Pointe Tree Lighting Ceremony in 2015. I am
            around the tree and I believe I was Rudolf that day. Below that is a picture of
            me getting ready to escort the Easter Bunny in Lincoln!</p>
		<p class="lead"> What really interests me</p>
		Video games of course! I play a lot of indie games. I don't do many AAA games, since
           I just wait until they are much cheaper if I even want it. I like scary games.
           Good luck getting me to actually play one, though. <br />
           Also, I love very chill music. Chill music is my life.</p>
